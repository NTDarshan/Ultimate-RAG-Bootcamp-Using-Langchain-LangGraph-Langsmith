LangChain Agents: Autonomous AI Decision Making

Agents in LangChain are autonomous systems that can make decisions about which tools to use and how to use them.
The Agent class combines a language model with a set of tools and decision-making logic to solve complex problems.
ReAct agents use a reasoning and acting pattern to break down problems and execute solutions step by step.
Zero-shot agents can work with tools they haven't seen before by using their descriptions and examples.
Conversational agents maintain context across interactions while having access to tools and external resources.
The AgentExecutor is responsible for running agents safely with proper error handling and execution limits.
Tools are the external capabilities that agents can use, such as search engines, calculators, or API calls.
Tool selection happens dynamically based on the agent's understanding of the current task and available options.
Agent memory allows for persistence of information across multiple interactions and tool uses.
Custom tools can be created by implementing the BaseTool interface with proper descriptions and input schemas.
Agent callbacks provide visibility into the decision-making process and tool usage for debugging and monitoring.
Multi-agent systems can be built where different agents specialize in different types of tasks or domains.
Agent planning involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps that can be executed sequentially.
Error recovery mechanisms help agents handle tool failures and unexpected situations gracefully.
Agent evaluation frameworks help measure the performance and reliability of autonomous systems.
Safety considerations include output filtering, tool access controls, and execution timeouts to prevent harmful actions.
