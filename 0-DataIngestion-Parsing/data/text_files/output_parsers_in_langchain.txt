LangChain Output Parsers: Structured Data from Language Models

Output parsers in LangChain convert unstructured language model responses into structured, usable data formats.
The BaseOutputParser class provides the foundation for all parsing implementations with validation and error handling.
PydanticOutputParser uses Pydantic models to define expected output schemas and automatically parse responses.
JSONOutputParser extracts and validates JSON data from language model responses with error recovery.
ListOutputParser converts comma-separated or numbered lists into Python list objects for further processing.
DatetimeOutputParser extracts and normalizes date and time information from natural language responses.
EnumOutputParser restricts outputs to predefined choices and validates that responses match expected options.
RegexParser uses regular expressions to extract specific patterns and information from model responses.
StructuredOutputParser combines multiple parsing strategies to handle complex, multi-field responses.
RetryOutputParser automatically retries parsing with corrected prompts when initial parsing fails.
OutputFixingParser attempts to repair malformed outputs by using additional language model calls.
CommaSeparatedListOutputParser specifically handles comma-delimited lists with proper escaping and trimming.
BooleanOutputParser converts natural language responses into boolean values with configurable true/false indicators.
Parser chaining allows multiple parsers to be combined for complex data extraction and transformation workflows.
Validation schemas ensure that parsed outputs meet business rules and data quality requirements.
Custom parsers can be created by extending BaseOutputParser to handle specialized output formats and validation rules.
