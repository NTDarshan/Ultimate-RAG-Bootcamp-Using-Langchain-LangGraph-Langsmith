LangChain Embeddings: Vector Representations for AI

Embeddings in LangChain convert text into high-dimensional vector representations that capture semantic meaning.
The Embeddings base class provides a consistent interface for different embedding model providers and implementations.
OpenAIEmbeddings integrates with OpenAI's text-embedding models for high-quality semantic representations.
HuggingFaceEmbeddings allows you to use any embedding model from the Hugging Face model hub locally.
SentenceTransformerEmbeddings specializes in creating embeddings optimized for semantic similarity tasks.
CohereEmbeddings provides access to Cohere's multilingual embedding models for global applications.
Embedding dimensions typically range from 384 to 1536 depending on the model and use case requirements.
Batch embedding processing improves efficiency when working with large collections of documents.
Embedding caching reduces computational costs by storing previously computed embeddings for reuse.
Normalization of embeddings ensures consistent similarity calculations across different vector spaces.
Embedding fine-tuning can improve performance for domain-specific applications and specialized vocabularies.
Multilingual embeddings enable cross-language semantic search and similarity matching capabilities.
Embedding evaluation involves measuring how well vectors capture semantic relationships in your specific domain.
Vector databases store and index embeddings for fast similarity search and retrieval operations.
Embedding visualization techniques help understand the semantic space and relationships between concepts.
Custom embedding models can be integrated by implementing the Embeddings interface with proper tokenization and encoding.
