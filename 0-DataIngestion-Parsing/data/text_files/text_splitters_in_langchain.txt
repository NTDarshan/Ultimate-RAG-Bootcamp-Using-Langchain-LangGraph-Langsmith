LangChain Text Splitters: Intelligent Document Chunking

Text splitters in LangChain break down large documents into smaller, manageable chunks for processing.
The TextSplitter base class provides the foundation for all splitting strategies with configurable parameters.
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter intelligently splits text while trying to keep related content together.
CharacterTextSplitter divides text based on specific characters like newlines or custom separators.
TokenTextSplitter splits text based on token count to ensure chunks fit within model context limits.
MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter preserves document structure by splitting on markdown headers and maintaining hierarchy.
HTMLHeaderTextSplitter processes HTML documents while preserving semantic structure and tag information.
CodeTextSplitter handles programming code with language-specific splitting that respects syntax boundaries.
LatexTextSplitter processes LaTeX documents while maintaining mathematical expressions and document structure.
PythonCodeTextSplitter specifically handles Python code with awareness of functions, classes, and logical blocks.
Chunk size configuration balances context preservation with processing efficiency and model limitations.
Chunk overlap ensures that important information spanning chunk boundaries is not lost during processing.
Semantic splitting attempts to break text at natural boundaries like sentences or paragraphs for better coherence.
Metadata preservation ensures that chunk-level information maintains references to source documents and locations.
Splitting evaluation helps optimize chunk size and overlap parameters for specific use cases and document types.
Custom splitters can be implemented to handle specialized document formats or domain-specific splitting requirements.
