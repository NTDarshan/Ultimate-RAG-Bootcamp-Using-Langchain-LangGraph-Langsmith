LangChain Vector Stores: Scalable Similarity Search

Vector stores in LangChain provide efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional embeddings for similarity search.
The VectorStore base class defines the standard interface for all vector database implementations.
Chroma is a lightweight, open-source vector database that's perfect for development and small-scale applications.
Pinecone offers a managed vector database service with high performance and scalability for production use.
Weaviate provides a cloud-native vector database with built-in vectorization and hybrid search capabilities.
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) enables efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
Qdrant is a vector similarity search engine with extended filtering support and high availability features.
Milvus is an open-source vector database built for scalable similarity search and AI applications.
Vector store operations include adding documents, similarity search, and maximum marginal relevance retrieval.
Metadata filtering allows you to combine vector similarity with traditional database-style filtering.
Index types like IVF, HNSW, and LSH offer different trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and memory usage.
Batch operations improve performance when adding or updating large numbers of documents in vector stores.
Vector store persistence ensures that your embeddings and metadata are saved between application sessions.
Hybrid search combines vector similarity with keyword search for more comprehensive retrieval capabilities.
Vector store scaling involves considerations like sharding, replication, and distributed query processing.
Custom vector stores can be implemented to integrate with proprietary or specialized similarity search systems.
