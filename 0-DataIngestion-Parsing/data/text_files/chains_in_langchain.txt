LangChain Chains: Orchestrating Complex AI Workflows

Chains in LangChain are the building blocks for creating complex AI applications by linking multiple components together.
The BaseChain class provides the foundation for all chain implementations with standardized input/output handling.
LLMChain is the most basic chain that combines a language model with a prompt template for simple text generation tasks.
SequentialChain allows you to chain multiple operations together where the output of one becomes the input of the next.
SimpleSequentialChain is a simplified version for linear workflows with single input/output between steps.
RouterChain enables conditional logic by routing inputs to different sub-chains based on content or criteria.
TransformChain allows you to apply custom transformations to data as it flows through your pipeline.
MapReduceChain is designed for processing large documents by splitting, processing in parallel, and combining results.
StuffDocumentsChain combines multiple documents into a single prompt for processing by a language model.
RefineDocumentsChain iteratively refines answers by processing documents one at a time and updating the response.
MapRerankDocumentsChain processes documents independently and ranks the results to find the best answer.
ConversationChain maintains context across multiple interactions for chatbot and conversational applications.
SummarizationChain specializes in creating concise summaries from longer text documents.
QAChain is optimized for question-answering tasks with built-in retrieval and response generation.
Chain composition allows you to build complex workflows by combining simpler chains in sophisticated ways.
Custom chains can be created by extending BaseChain and implementing the required methods for your specific use case.
