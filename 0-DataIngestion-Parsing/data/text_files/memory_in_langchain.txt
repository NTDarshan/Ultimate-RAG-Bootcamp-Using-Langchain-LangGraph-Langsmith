LangChain Memory: Maintaining Context in AI Applications

Memory components in LangChain enable AI applications to maintain context and state across multiple interactions.
The BaseMemory class provides the foundation for all memory implementations with standardized read/write operations.
ConversationBufferMemory stores the complete conversation history for maintaining full context in chat applications.
ConversationBufferWindowMemory keeps only the last N interactions to manage memory usage in long conversations.
ConversationSummaryMemory creates summaries of older conversations to maintain context while reducing memory footprint.
ConversationSummaryBufferMemory combines recent messages with summaries of older interactions for optimal context management.
EntityMemory tracks and maintains information about specific entities mentioned throughout the conversation.
KnowledgeGraphMemory builds and maintains a knowledge graph of relationships between entities and concepts.
VectorStoreRetrieverMemory uses similarity search to retrieve relevant past interactions based on current context.
Memory persistence allows conversation state to be saved and restored across application sessions.
Memory serialization enables memory state to be stored in databases or files for long-term persistence.
Conversation memory can be shared across multiple chains or agents for consistent context management.
Memory optimization techniques help balance context retention with computational and storage efficiency.
Custom memory classes can be created to implement specialized context management for specific use cases.
Memory evaluation involves measuring how well context is maintained and utilized across interactions.
Memory security considerations include data privacy, access controls, and sensitive information handling.
