LangChain Retrievers: Intelligent Information Retrieval

Retrievers in LangChain are components designed to fetch relevant information from various data sources efficiently.
The BaseRetriever class provides a standardized interface for all retrieval implementations in the framework.
VectorStoreRetriever uses embedding-based similarity search to find relevant documents from vector databases.
BM25Retriever implements the BM25 algorithm for keyword-based document retrieval with term frequency scoring.
TFIDFRetriever uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for traditional information retrieval tasks.
SelfQueryRetriever can interpret natural language queries and convert them into structured database queries.
MultiQueryRetriever generates multiple variations of a query to improve retrieval coverage and accuracy.
EnsembleRetriever combines multiple retrieval methods to leverage the strengths of different approaches.
ContextualCompressionRetriever filters and compresses retrieved documents to focus on the most relevant content.
ParentDocumentRetriever maintains relationships between document chunks and their parent documents for better context.
TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever considers both relevance and recency when ranking retrieved documents.
MultiVectorRetriever can work with multiple vector representations of the same document for improved matching.
Retrieval evaluation metrics help measure the quality and effectiveness of different retrieval strategies.
Hybrid retrieval combines dense and sparse retrieval methods for optimal performance across different query types.
Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) patterns use retrievers to provide context for language model responses.
Custom retrievers can be implemented to work with proprietary data sources or specialized retrieval algorithms.
